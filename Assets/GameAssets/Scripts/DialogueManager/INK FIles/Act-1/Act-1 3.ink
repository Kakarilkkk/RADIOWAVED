…Seryoga, what’s going on with the pressure?
It should stabilize now, I think.
It’s only going up, call the shop supervisor… Oh, damn.

Mother of God, vent it! Vent it, I said—open all the valves… Grab a crowbar, you unwashed idiot!
…
Everyone out of the shop, get the hell out of here. Drop that crap already, it’s spinning out of control… Damn it, I SAID DROP IT!
