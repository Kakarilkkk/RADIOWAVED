…Love turnips! Love turnips, my children — this is what I say to you, the master of the turnip club of our settlement.

There is strength, wisdom, and greatness in turnips. It’s no coincidence that the turnip is the central element of the eponymous fairy tale. Its cultural influence is very significant.

Turnips are not only tasty but also healthy. Eat turnips.

Of course, foolish fans of disgusting beans will claim the opposite, but don’t listen to those who marinate their produce in tin wombs before eating. They lie to you.

If it weren’t for them, we could have established mass production of turnip fertilizers at the factory, but now look — the factory lies in ruins. And it’s entirely their fault!
