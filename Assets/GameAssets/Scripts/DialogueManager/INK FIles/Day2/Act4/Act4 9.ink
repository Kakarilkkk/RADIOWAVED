-Ignat Semyonovich, what do you command to do with the director?
-That fool? Start an investigation into why the plant blew up. Make everything public; the main thing is to put him behind bars.
-Sorry, but weren't you the one who appointed him yourself, Mr. Mayor?
-Ha! That fool was needed so we could shift all the blame onto him and the turnip and bean clubs. Nothing more. We've almost dealt with the clubs; only he remains.
-Understood, I will pass this on to the police chief.
