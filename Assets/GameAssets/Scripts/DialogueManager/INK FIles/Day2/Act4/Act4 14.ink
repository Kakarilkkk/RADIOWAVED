... Recording number one. I am a junior researcher at the Department of Chronological Unified Rational Scientific Research. My team and I are currently working on developing new fertilizers based on hydraulically compressed chickens.

By order of the mayor, we were supposed to implement this fertilizer at our factory, but... The last experiment ended in disaster. Damn it!

This wonderful invention could save many people dying from hunger, but because of the mayor, who appointed some idiot as the factory director, everything is falling apart. 

Damn, I have to go, someone is walking in the corridor... I’ll try to go on air again later, I don’t know if anyone will hear me.
