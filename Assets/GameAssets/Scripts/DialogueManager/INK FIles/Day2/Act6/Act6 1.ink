And once again, on air, the program “Young Radio Technician.” We broadcast every morning and evening daily.

We continue our lecture series about radio.

We hope you are not missing our broadcasts. Last time, we talked about how to listen to the radio correctly.

Today, we will discuss why you should listen to the radio in the first place.

Radio should primarily be listened to for mental health. Fresh news energizes and invigorates you for the entire day, and wonderful music helps in difficult moments.

With radio, you are never alone; you don’t know silence or boredom.

With radio, you are always on the wave, always part of a team, always in trend.

Listen to the radio.

Tomorrow, we will return with more interesting advice. Stay on the wave. Listen to the radio.
